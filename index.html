    <h1 style="text-align:center;">CARBON CHECKING </h1>
    <p style="font-size:160%;"> Welcome students to your daily carbon checkup page. This page is specially designed for you to keep track of total carbon emission in a day. This website has different set of pages but first lets learn more about how carbon footprinting works. </p>
    <p style="font-size:160%;">Lets first discuss about some of our daily consumed food items and other products</p>
    <p style="font-size:150%;color: #331d01;text-align:center;"><strong><em>--Coffee--</em> </p></strong>
    <p style="font-size:125%">How many cups of coffee do you consume in a day on average? Probably 1 or 2 right? Let me share with you something interesting.<br>Being an RPI student we all know how important our morning coffe is. Our day or atleast mine does not start without a dose of caffeine. Thats what keeps me going during my data structures classes and during cold snowy days.<br> But have we ever put a thought into how our one cup of coffee might actually be impacting the home we live in? Everything comes with a cost, so does our cup of coffee.</p>
    <p style = "font-size:125%"> According to a research, one pound of coffee produces on average about 11 
        pounds of carbon! By having 1 cup of coffee a day it is calculated that you may be contributing to 
        155 kg greenhouse gas emissions yearly. Thatâ€™s roughly the equivalent of driving a car for 640km!I know this sounds incredible but sometimes we fail to realise that what
        we take in also leaves a result back in this environment.<br>
        As said by Issac Newton " EVERY ACTION HAS AN EQUAL AND OPPOSITE REACTION"<br>
        But its never late to start taking a step towards sustainibility<br>
        It was found that by changing how coffee is grown, transported and consumed, 
        carbon emissions by coffee can be reduced by 77%.
        Lets discuss how make this change!</p>
    <p style="color: #331d01;font-size:160%;text-align:center"><strong><em>Solutions</em></strong></p>
    <p style = "font-size:125%"> 1)By changing the cups in which we drink the coffe in, we can decrease the emmison by a great mark. Swithcing
    from plastic and aluminium cups and lids to compostable and organic we not only contribute towards sustainibilty but also help farmers in earning their fair wages.</p>
    <p style = "font-size:125%"> 2)By switching the milk we use from dairy to plan based can reduce carbon emission. All plant-based milk have a lower carbon footprint than dairy milk.</p>
    <p style = "font-size:125%">3)Third point is something I observed daily being on campus. To break it down, every cup of coffee requires sugar, creamer, lid, stirer,straw and sometimes
    even more.Even though RPI has tried to establish the best ways of making this process as environmental friendly as possible, I still cant fail to
    mention the amount of straws, sugar packets and creamer cups used and thrown after. For our 5 mins of enjoyment we dispose atleast a 10 year unrecyclable waste froduct 
    into this world. So I think minimizing and limitung the use of these and keeping track of how many pack
